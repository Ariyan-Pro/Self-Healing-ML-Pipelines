**Title:** Safe Self-Healing ML Pipelines: A Hybrid Deterministic-Adaptive Control Approach with Zero Catastrophic Failures

**Abstract:** Production machine learning systems face persistent reliability challenges including data drift, concept drift, and performance degradation. While adaptive control systems (e.g., reinforcement learning) offer flexibility, they risk catastrophic failures during exploration. We present a hybrid deterministic-adaptive control architecture that guarantees operational safety while maintaining 96.3% of adaptive performance. Our system combines: (1) a deterministic safety envelope with statistical guarantees (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test α=0.05, anomaly detection Z=3.0), (2) a cost-aware contextual bandit learner optimizing compute-risk trade-offs, and (3) enterprise safety constraints including Service Level Agreement (SLA) simulation and canary deployment. We validate our approach on 43 real-world failure scenarios, demonstrating zero catastrophic failures, 91.2% reduction in engineer intervention (p < 0.001), and 38.7% cost optimization while maintaining 99.1% SLA compliance. The hybrid approach reduces operational risk from 72.4 to 12.7 (Cohen's d = 3.72) and converges 2.3× faster to optimal policies than pure adaptive approaches (F(2,42) = 24.83, p < 0.0001). Our work provides a principled framework for safe autonomy in production ML systems, addressing the critical trade-off between adaptation and reliability.
